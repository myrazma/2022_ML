# 2022_ML

In this repository I have an example for NLP in machine learning that I did in my freetime. Besides that I'm working on other projects / master's thesis for Uni, which are private right now since I'm still working on them.

## Bi-LSTM
In this project, I created a Bi-LSTM model for named entity recognition using PyTorch and numpy.

Folder: [BILSTM_NLP](BILSTM_NLP/)

## Note
This project is showing work I did besides University and / or work. Therefore, this is a rather small project that I can share publically. Besides that I'm currently working on a more projects in Machine Leanring, NLP and Data Analysis, which I cannot share due to other students participating on the code or unpublished work like my Master's thesis.
